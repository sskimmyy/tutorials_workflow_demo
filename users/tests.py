# The django_user_model fixture is a built-in fixture. It acts as a shortcut to accessing the User model for this project.
# This fixture creates a new user with the Django create_user() method and sets a username and password.
# Then it returns the username and password as a tuple.  

def test_login_user(client, test_user):
    test_username, test_password = test_user  # this unpacks the tuple
    login_result = client.login(username=test_username, password=test_password)
    assert login_result == True

# In this code, the client passed in as a parameter is a built-in "dummy web client" provided by Django as part of its testing tools.
# It mimics some of the functionality of a web browser and helps us test interacting with a Django app. 
# Its login() method helps us test that we can log into the app, and the test_user fixture makes sure that we have a valid user to test with.
